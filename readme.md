# Learning Snippets

This repo's got some code I've written (or reproduced) for the sake of (re-)learning some stuff. Check it out:

- **dsfs** Some code and adaptations for my own edification of Joel Grus' [Data Science from Scratch](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do)

- **neural-nets** Doing some basic implementations of neural networks of various types, including some exercises/prompts from [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)
